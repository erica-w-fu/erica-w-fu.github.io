Since we found that young tech-savvy travelers have little problem finding disjoint attractions, lodging, and flights, the application allows users to easily input those bookings and lists of attractions. However, users revealed that taking those scattered lists and creating a concrete schedule was often tedious, thus our app can take all of those inputs and traveling preferences to generate a travel schedule for the user.\"\n                    img={ UserFlow }\n                />\n            </Section>\n            <Section \n                title=\"Ideating\"\n            >\n                <Sub \n                    header=\"Crazy 8's\"\n                    body=\"We quickly generated eight unique ideas to explore different potential solutions based on our research.\"\n                    img={ Crazy8s }\n                />\n                <Sub \n                    header=\"Speed Dating\"\n                    body=\"We also generated and tested 9 different storyboards (some pictured below) based on user needs from our research and featuring different designs to see what people actually found useful.\"\n                    img={ SpeedDating }\n                    imgType=\"wide\"\n                />\n            </Section>\n            <Section \n                title=\"Solution\"\n            >\n                <Sub \n                    header=\"Traveling itinerary curator and scheduler\"\n                    body=\"Our final solution is focused on connecting the searching process of disjoint attractions, food, and experiences with the schedule creating process of connecting those itinerary items into a concrete schedule.\"\n                    img={ Solution }\n                    imgType=\"wide\"\n                />\n                <Sub \n                    header=\"Concept Model\"\n                    body=\"We created a concept model to illustrate how a user could go through all the features: making a profile with travel preferences, finding itinerary items based on location, viewing where friends have traveled to, and generating a trip to a location with the saved posts and added in logistical info – such as flights and lodging.\"\n                    img={ ConceptModel }\n                />\n                <Sub \n                    header=\"Wireframes\"\n                    body=\"We created some wireframes to demonstrate how a user may discover new travel items nearby to places they already want to travel to.
