While modern ML systems have shown promising performance, they can still encode problematic\n                    patterns, for example, basic grammatical failures, biases against people of color, and systematic disparities in\n                    clinical diagnoses. Detecting and fixing these specific issues, often termed behavioral testing or evaluation, requires going beyond calculating aggregate metrics such as accuracy and F1 score and understanding specific patterns of model\n                    behavior.\"\n                />\n            </Section>\n            <Section\n                title=\"Our Solution\"\n            >\n                <Sub \n                    header=\"A behavioral evaluation API and interactive model exploration interface\"\n                    body=\"Given the limitations and low adoption of any machine learning evaluation tools, Zeno focuses on flexibility to ensure that people with any level of machine learning knowledge are able to use the tool for any type of data. \n                    Combining an API for all types of models, metadata, and functions with an interactive user interface to explore model performance on slices of data, Zeno allows all teams that help develop and maintain machine learning models to easily identify issues, create reports to present to different stakeholders, and select the best model to deploy.\"\n                    img={ Solution }\n                />\n            </Section>\n            <Section \n                title=\"Research\"\n            >\n                <Sub \n                    header=\"Interviews\"\n                    body=\"When I entered the project, the project had already conducted their formative study interviews.
