Based on the stage people are at, they would want different ways of finding where to go, whether that be through photos from friends or proximity. Since many participants from speed dating mentioned that they found the scheduling of disjoint locations tedious, our solution would be able to take disjoint locations and conveniently create a concrete schedule.
